Beginner DSA Guide

Welcome to the Beginner DSA Guide! This repository is designed to help you navigate your journey in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using C++. If you’re here, you’ve already taken the first step towards mastering DSA—congratulations on your commitment!

My DSA Journey: A Love-Hate Relationship

Learning DSA was a challenging journey for me. One of the biggest hurdles I faced was not having a clear blueprint—a step-by-step path—to guide me on which data structures to learn first. I kept bouncing between topics, learning one thing only to switch back to another. I know it sounds simple when people say, “Just follow a tech YouTuber’s playlist”, and indeed, there are plenty of good ones out there.

But here’s the reality: The worst thing you can do while learning something new is to rely on tutorials. Why? Let me explain.

My Experience with Tutorial Hell

You could end up watching a 200-video playlist, only to finish with zero problem-solving ability and countless Leetcode questions unanswered. I realized this the hard way after spending months in tutorial hell, watching video after video without truly understanding how things work at a low level. Eventually, when I tried to answer questions, I felt like I was mimicking someone else’s words rather than expressing my understanding.

What I Learned

Here’s my advice to you:

	•	Never follow any tutorial blindly. Instead:
	•	Start by reading about the topics you want to learn.
	•	Get familiar with the terminology.
	•	Spend a few days exploring articles and books.
	•	Continuously ask yourself “Why?” For example, Why do we need this data structure? Why is this algorithm efficient? Seek to understand the purpose and the why behind each concept.

Yes, you will fail multiple times. But when you encounter challenges and actively search for answers, there will be moments when everything suddenly clicks. And trust me, those “aha” moments are the most rewarding feeling you’ll experience. They’re what make all the struggles worth it, and they’re what keep you away from the tutorial trap.

Why I Built This Guide

I’m just someone who spent months being stuck in tutorial hell, imitating the knowledge of others rather than truly owning it. I don’t want that for you. This guide aims to provide a clear structure and hands-on learning experience to help you build a strong foundation in DSA.

What to Expect

This guide covers essential DSA topics, each with C++ implementations to solidify your understanding:

	•	1. Arrays & Hashing
	•	2. Stack
	•	3. Two Pointers
	•	4. Sliding Window
	•	5. Trees & Graphs
	•	And more…

Feel free to explore each section and tackle problems to sharpen your skills.

Final Words

Remember, your DSA journey is unique, and it’s never too late to start. Embrace the challenges, stay curious, and focus on understanding rather than just watching.

Good luck on your DSA journey! 🚀
