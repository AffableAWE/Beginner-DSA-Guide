## ðŸ’¡ **My DSA Journey: A Love-Hate Relationship**

Learning DSA was a challenging endeavor for me. One of the biggest hurdles I faced was the absence of a clear roadmapâ€”a step-by-step guide on which data structures to learn first. I often found myself oscillating between topics, learning one concept only to switch back to another. While many suggest following a tech YouTuberâ€™s playlist, and there are indeed numerous quality ones available, I discovered a critical insight:

**The Pitfall of Tutorial Dependency**

Relying solely on tutorials can lead to a situation where you might complete an extensive playlist yet find yourself lacking problem-solving skills and facing numerous unanswered LeetCode questions. I realized this after spending months in a cycle of watching videos without truly grasping the underlying mechanics. When attempting to solve problems, I felt like I was merely echoing someone elseâ€™s explanations rather than articulating my understanding.

## ðŸ§  **Lessons Learned**

Here's my advice to you:

- **Avoid Blindly Following Tutorials**: Instead:
  - Begin by reading about the topics you wish to learn.
  - Familiarize yourself with the terminology.
  - Spend time exploring articles and books.
  - Continuously ask yourself "Why?" For instance, why do we need this data structure? Why is this algorithm efficient? Seek to understand the purpose and reasoning behind each concept.

Yes, you may encounter failures along the way. However, facing challenges and actively seeking solutions will lead to those "aha" moments when everything suddenly makes sense. These moments are incredibly rewarding and will keep you from falling into the tutorial trap.
